Today I got to work early and left on time. But everything in the middle was an unsatisfying,
unproductive pile of mud. None of the projects I tried to work on were well defined enough for
me to make any progress on them and getting that information was like pulling teeth or impossible.
I wrote an email to Nate, updating him on the current situation, in reply to his email wherein he
hoped that things were going well at Lendio. They are not. I hate working at Lendio. Everybody is
close minded, narrow-visioned, ROI nazi, short-sighted, non-innovative, rude, trolling, uncaring,
mean, stupid, idiotic, inconsistent, brain-dead, bone-headed, unprofessional, etc. 
I miss the people at DDM. I miss the process, the structure, the good practices, the opportunities 
to try new things. I miss the understanding and empathy. I miss the quiet and steady progress. I 
miss knowing exactly what is expected of me. I miss the collaboration, pair programming, and weekly 
tasking. I miss everything about DDM.
I start so many side projects but soon become disincentivized by my work situation. I see no point
working on side projects when I know I won't get any opportunity to make a difference at work. It's
very frustrating. I don't know what to do.
I asked Miles today if he received an email from a Google recruiter if he would entertain it. He
said he would. I'm miserable at Lendio. I am not with my peers. My peers would be glad to talk about
new technologies, even if they weren't immediately relevant. My peers would empathize with me that
the code they've written is not easy to understand and maintain. My peers would embrace Test Driven
Development. I don't know where I will find my peers. I must find them. I will be miserable until I
do. But where can I find them? Do they exist? Where?
Perhaps God will give me a vision to know where they are and if they exist? Perhaps I just need to
look around and research different companies.
I need side projects. I need exposure.
