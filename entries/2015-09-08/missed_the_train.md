Today I missed the train.

My wife told me breakfast at 6:45 and we leave at 7:00. 6:45 came along and nobody was
working on making breakfast. 7:00 came around and I had only started eating breakfast.
I finished my last bite and considered taking the bus at the stop right by our house.
I discovered there was a bus leaving at 7:00. I looked out the window and saw it 
leaving. So I had no option but to wait. We ended up leaving around 7:20. This only
gave us 10 minutes to get to the North Temple Frontrunner station. Google Maps driving
directions told us it would take 18 minutes at least. My wife raced to get there. But
cars blocked our way and we were forced to drive as slow as everyone else for most the
way. I looked up the Frontrunner schedule to make sure there actually was a 7:30 train.
The schedule omits the 7:30 train. But when we arrived at North Temple Station, there
was a train sitting on the tracks. I doubted it was the southbound train. But turns out
it was. And within the few seconds I stood there wondering on the platform it left.

Brilliant. I looked up directions on Google Maps which indicated there actually is a 
7:30 train.
