# Waking Up Late

I keep waking up late. It's quite frustrating. I go to bed late too. Last night because my wife wanted me to do some packing in the garage. I gotta figure out how to wake up on time. First of all, I think I need to go to bed on time. That's the most important part. Without that I'm doomed to fail. I also need to condition myself to wake up on the first alarm. That's the hardest part.

So how am I going to do it? Let's talk about going to bed on time. First, I think it needs to be established in my wife's mind, that bed time is a hard rule and there is absollutely no breaking it. Second, I need to give heed to my alarms and not just bypass them. I have an alarm a half an hour before bedtime to remind to be get ready for bed. I also have an alarm at bedtime. I will silence the alarm for one more game. I need to stop doing that.

Next, conditioning myself to wake up on the first alarm. I've removed all snooze alarms. Next Miles Victors suggested something I've never considered: drink a glass of water before bed time. Supposedly, this will create the urge to urinate upon waking. So instead of going back to sleep you must rush off to the bathroom. I think it's a great idea I need to try.

Why is it so important to wake up on time? If you wake up on time, and do it early enough, you can squeeze in often neglected activities, such as exercise, reading, writing, planning, etc. Waking up late has a ripple effect on everything else in your day. You wake up late. You go to work late. You leave work late. You get home late. You spend less time with children. And I often feel underaccomplished or disatisfied with my day and resist going to bed on time until I've unwound.

There's a lot that can be accomplished in a day but you have to start it off right. Every day I want to strive to make progress in all aspects of my life. It's difficult when I'm sloppy with my schedule. So I must wake up on time. I must go to bed on time. I must give heed to my alarms.

My body hurts a lot. I think that makes me tired too. I need exercise badly. If I could wake up on time I could go swimming, or go for a jog, or bike ride, or just do a simple routine. I have a lot of back and neck pain. My hamstrings are really tight. I feel heavy and it's hard to move quickly.

I've gotta get it together and start living like I want to live and let nothing get in my way. No apologies. No mercy. No fear. Just go for it with everything I've got. I need to play less video games, get more exercise, work more on side projects, callings, and family. No excuses.

No excuses. So tonight I'm going to listen to my bedtime alarms, drink a huge cup of water, and get to bed without delay. And in the morning, I'm going to hit the alarm only one time and make my way to the bathroom to urinate. There's no resisting the urge to pee. It's unstoppable.

As for exercise, I will do a simple routine. Some abs. Some chest. Some back. Some arms. Some stretching. And I walk to work so that's worth something too.

On another note, my wife and I are getting ready to move next week. We've got nearly everything packed. Last night I packed the garage, or just collected all the boxes to the front of the garage. There's not much to pack since I use boxes to organize things.
